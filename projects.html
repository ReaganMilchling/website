      <h3>Voxel video game</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>This is the latest video game I've been working on. It is a voxel based renderer written in C++ using OpenGL and CMake. I am trying to keep the number of libraries I use to minimum because I like writing things myself.</p>
        <p>Here's a few pictures. It looks suspiciously like Minecraft. I was quite stunned at how easy it was to imitate Minecraft's water look. I clearly haven't figured out how to shade the voxel sides different colors nor implement ambient occlusion.</p>

      <h3>TDF IDF search engine in C</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In College I took a class called Information Retrieval. The class was basically a semester long project on building a search engine. I originally wrote it in (some terrible) Python code.</p>
        <p>I wanted to challenge myself so I decided to rewrite it in C. And I took the oppurtunity to write generic hashmaps in C. I also improved single thread parsing time 25x, which was pretty satisfying.</p>

      <h3>RSA Keypair Generation</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Another College project. This one I haven't rewritten. It can generate RSA key-pairs and crack given a RSA key-pair (only if it has a few hundred bits).</p>
