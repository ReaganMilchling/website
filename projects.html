      <h3>Voxel video game</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>This is the latest video game I've been working on. It is a voxel based renderer written in C++ using OpenGL and CMake.</p>
        <p>Here's a few pictures. It looks suspiciously like Minecraft.</p>

      <h3>TDF IDF search engine in C</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The original project was a from a college course that had semester long project on building a search engine. Originally written in Python.</p>
        <p>I rewrote it in C as a fun challenge and I took the oppurtunity to write generic hashmaps in C. I improved single thread parsing time 25x by naively rewriting.</p>

      <h3>Http Server in C</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Writing an http server in C. Goal is to implement the minimum required to test this website on a local network.</p>

      <h3>RSA Keypair Generation</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Another College project. This rewrite is in progress. The new goal is to implement ssh-keygen. It can generate RSA key-pairs and crack given an RSA key-pair (only if it has a few hundred bits).</p>
